# BACKGROUND AND PROJECT OBJECTIVE (VENDOR)

### Background:

* Genentech USMA is investigating the presence of substantial unwarranted care variation in breast cancer patients throughout the US with the objective of understanding this variation better, identifying the potential causes for this and exploring how to address it.
 * Genentech’s clinical gap problem: (1) Clinicians make decisions based on what they know is efficacious and safe, (2) Treatment decisions are sometimes based on supply-sensitive issues, and (3) Treatment decisions are sometimes based on a conscious or unconscious preference
 * Genentech’s Needs Assessment statement:  (1) the effect of unwarranted care variations on patients receiving timely evidence-based practice, (2) the impact unwarranted care variations has as a potential barrier to Genentech evidence
* Breast cancer is a very different condition in terms of the types of patients involved, the length and type of care that they receive and the likely nature of the variation in care. Twine Analytics and the Genentech USMA learning and clinical integration team propose to work together to leverage extensive secondary data in breast cancer available to Genentech, as well as tap into additional secondary public data sources to further explore the variation in care of breast cancer patients and help target learning initiatives to address it.


### Project Objectives:


1. Utilize secondary data to map the breast cancer patient care experience, with a particular focus on the HER2+ patient population, including specifically differentiating between the neoadjuvant, adjuvant and metastatic settings
2. Identify any potential care variation based on lack of concordance to national guideline recommendations (e.g. NCCN) for the HER2+ patient population, including at the testing/diagnosis and treatment stages
3. Determine potential drivers/reasons for variation in care (assuming it exists), including behavioral and systems/process related factors (e.g. impact of access/reimbursement/pathways, infrastructure, etc)

# SCOPE OF WORK AND DELIVERABLES
We propose to complete this Breast Cancer Care Experience Needs Assessment project utilizing the following 4 step approach:

1. Data Access and Integration:
    1. We propose to integrate multiple datasets (both Genentech proprietary and public) to develop a holistic understanding of the treatment of breast cancer in the US and the key factors that impact it, as available in the data
    1. The datasets likely to be included:
        1. Public Data:
            1. SEER data
            1. Census data
            1. Reimbursement claims data from CMS
            1. Clinicaltrials.gov
            1. CMS open payments data (aka Sunshine data)
            1. Physician Compare database
            1. Hospital Compare database
            1. Oncology care model, NCCN list and commission on cancer accreditation data
        1. Genentech Proprietary and Third Party Data:
            1. SHA Symphony claims data
            1. IMS prescription and sales data
            1. HCOS affiliation data
            1. Payer mix data
            1. Reimbursement status and access situation data (e.g. Zitter health)
    1. The datasets will be integrated using our proprietary ETL (Extract, transform and load) methodology on the Twine cloud-based HADOOP and SPARK technology stack
    1. During this step, we will make every attempt to leverage the existing data from the gSonar platform, based on availability and per compliance guidelines
    1. Twine will provide Genentech the ability to transfer the data models generated specific to this engagement back to the Genentech infrastructure with documentation, as required.

2. Develop A Framework To Analyze the Overall Care Experience and Identify Variation In Care For Breast Cancer
    1. Twine will work with the USMA team to develop a framework to map the treatment of breast cancer across the various steps, including screening, diagnosis and treatment across various lines of therapy for the different patient types
    1. We will conduct literature review and gather data on the recommended guidelines and best practices in the treatment of breast cancer and develop a definition of care variation for breast cancer, and identify the specific factors to determine care variation
    1. Integrate the various data sources, refine the available data, as well as project and estimate additional data as required at the HSA and local health system and institution level to map the entire treatment flow for breast cancer based on the defined breast cancer care variation framework

3. Evaluate Breast Cancer Care Variation And Identify Potential Factors Associated with Care Variation (At the HSA and Individual Health System/Institution Level)
  1. Twine will leverage its data analytical capabilities to model the treatment of breast cancer at the sub-national level
  2. We will map estimated treatment patterns with the recognized and accepted optimal care guidelines for breast cancer to identify potential variation in care
  3. Work with the USMA team to hypothesize local and regional factors involving accounts, physicians, patients, payers and diagnostic labs that may lead to variation in care (e.g. type of hospitals, number of physicians, access to labs, Commission on Cancer accreditation status of hospital, etc)
  4. Conduct analysis of the data to identify the impact of these factors, as well as identify additional factors generated by statistical analysis of the volume of data. The output of this step will be to generate a list of potential drivers of the variation of care based on the variety of data sources.

4. Develop user interfaces and provide recommendations For USMA Learning & Clinical Integration Intervention
  1. Twine will develop an intuitive user interface for the USMA team to explore the data and analysis at the sub-national level. This interface should allow the team to mine the data and also quickly understand the degree in variation of care, the specific sub-national areas of interest at the HSA and individual hospital level as well as understand the likely drivers of the variation in care
  1. We will work with the USMA team to identify specific HSAs, health systems and/or hospitals of interest for further exploration
  1. We will conduct further analyses on the existing secondary data to identify specific drivers of variation in these selected groups
  1. We will also work with the team to help design and develop primary market research questions to validate the hypothesized drivers of variation
  1. The final recommendations will be included in a executive summary and may include the following:
      1. Degree and type of variation in care for breast cancer in the US
      1. Distribution of variation in care by HSA regions and at the individual health system/institution level
      1. Hypotheses around potential drivers of the variation in care
